							<h3>Life of Bee-keeping with Olympus OMD EM5 and 45mm f/1.8</h3>
							<span>3rd June, 2014 at 3:05pm</span>
							<p>
								Shooting insects is always fun; and when you are shooting honey-bees it is full of sweet passion. Beekeeping or Apiculture is sometimes a full time job for a large group of people in Southern Bengal (India). They are from unimaginable economic condition, hence risks their lives to the fullest to get some living out of it with their ‘pets’. Normally, they are not even insured or financed by Central Banks; rather they take loan from local land-mafias and are often exploited. It is a sad story! But the irony is, I have never seen them without smiling. I have my business-place nearby a large Eukaliptas Woods and I mix with them a lot when I photo-walk through it. They always greet me with fresh spoonful of honey, (which always tastes heavenly) and they look at my face with huge expectation of a satisfied-smile! They are probably the poorest people I have ever come with and probably the most Happy!
